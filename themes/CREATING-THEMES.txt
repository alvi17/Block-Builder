There are currently two ways to create a new theme for Klooni:


The easy way
============
1. Copy the ``template.svg`` and paste it under this directory.
2. Name the copied file the way you wish to call the theme (e.g. `mytheme.svg`).
3. Modify the file with a .svg editor, preferrably Inkscape.
4. When you're done, run ``python3 generate_theme.py`` and follow the wizard.
5. Done!


The "hard" way
==============
1. Go into ``Klooni/android/assets/themes``.
2. Copy any theme file.
3. Modify the hexadecimal values of the colors with a text editor.
4. Remember to add your new theme filename to the ``theme.list`` file.
5. Done!
